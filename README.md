# The Rebaze Release Name Project

This repository is growing collection of release-name families.
The intention is to list groups of names that can be used to name software releases.
Everyong probably knows the Google Naming scheme.

While you probably can easily find any number of cohesive groups that can serve as release naming theme, this repo tries to limit it to actually usable schemes that are somwhat fun to work with (not too boring) and not to commonly used (such as sweet desert in Android).

Sometimes the collections can be ordered so that naming is somewhat predictable, but it is not a prerequisite (yet).
